#EVENT CLASSIFICATION, DETECTION &amp; SUMMARIZATION


ABSTRACT

The combination of large open data sources with machine learning approaches presents a potentially powerful way to predict events such as protest or social unrest. However, accounting for certainty in such models depends on the data particularly when using diverse, unstructured datasets such
as social media. A non-governmental organization, The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), collates and manually analyzes data on political violence and protest around the world. Manual method of collating data creates a lag of 7 days. In this paper we propose a system that automates ACLED and works on real time data. This system uses TextRank algorithm for Text Summarization, Naive Bayes machine leaning model for classification and\ event detection task. To extract entities out of text, we used a tool called SPACY and to get accurate event date we used Stanford Temporal Tagger.
